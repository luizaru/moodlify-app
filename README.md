## Introduction <a id="description"></a>

Moodlify is a single page web application that is designed to help (users) students track their mood over time, as well as track what factors are influencing their daily mood. This is meant to help people better understand their mental health and make note of which daily habits are positively or negatively impacting their lifestyles. As a busy professional and a full-time student who is trying to balance between studies, work, and life, I like many others have my mental health struggles and I often find it difficult to manage and cope with my daily responsibilities. Mental health is becoming a common topic of discussion and rightfully so, good mental health is essential to good health. According to the World Health Organisation, currently 11% of the world population is dealing with mental health disorders like depression, anxiety, insomnia and more. As I already mentioned, it is not a secret that such problems are common among students and often, they could exaggerate during their course of study. It is not a secret that talking about mental health issues and coming out as having such is still a stigma. And that many times stigma makes them unrecognizable and therefore there are not many solutions that are currently addressing them. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Services (UCAS) are seeing 450% increase over the past 10 years in the willingness of the students to come forward and share they are struggling with their mental health. Therefore, it is still a difficult to get through topic but hopefully in the next few years we will be seeing more people talking about this and looking for advice and help. There is a rise in stress levels and negative emotions due to the need to attend lectures, study for assignments, and balance work and personal life. There is also constant pressure to succeed and the need for competitiveness that are playing a role in making the students anxious and depressed. Consequently, that results in mood swings that are affecting their personality and mental health. This could also lead to bipolar disorders so monitoring and taking actions in the early stages is a key. The aim of the app is to serve as a mood diary that will help students track their moods daily as well as make notes. This will encourage them to pay attention to how they feel. And prompt them to seek professional medical help, if necessary, especially if they sense negative emotions are overflowing the positive ones. 

## Methodology <a id="methodology"></a>
For this part of the assessment and for the development of the SAP I chose to use Waterfall methodlogy. The reason why is that Waterfall is one of the most common and traditional methodlogies. And it is commonly used for small projects, like this one. So I broke done the development stages into dependent of eachother sequential phases. I first started with the structure and the folders of the application. I then started adding the components, the views and the configiration. Firebase was pretty much added the last. The phases I used to develop this app were the following: 

1. Requirement Analysis 
2. High Level desing
3. Coding and Unit Testing 
4. Integration Testing 
5. System Testing 
5. Implementation 

The methodology I used to obtain the inital user base and create the requirements analysis was Design Thinking (DT). The reason why that was my choice is that Design Thinking is a human-centred process and helps develop innovative solutions by putting the user needs and requirements first above anything else (Razzouk, R. and Shute, V., 2012). It also aims to understand the potential problem, get the point of view (or points of view), ideate, and help in the prototyping process. It is also a non-linear process which means it could be applied in many ways and iterations until the best solution is found. Additionally, it will also allow me to use a range of tactics and gather the best results.

Observation is one of the oldest and most fundamental research approaches (Brigitte Smit.2022). That is why observing the students and empathising their needs, as well as paying attention to how they interact in their environments, was my initial point of concentration. I decided to use a covert nonparticipant observation (Laurier, E., 2016) which refers to observing the participants without them knowing. This gave me time to reflect and consider the who am I going to build this for and what really is their problem. In the period of two months, I managed to observe several students. I had the opportunity to examine and analyse how they interacted with one another, how they absorbed knowledge, how they felt during lectures and study sessions, and how they understood and processed all of that throughout this time. By taking notes, I also tried to answer questions about their behaviour, what is stressing them out the most, whether they experience anxiety, mood swings and other metal health related issues and signs. From their interactions and communication with others with the time I understood that most of the students are hard workers. More than 60% of the students I observed were juggling around their studies, full-time jobs, families, and kids that they needed to take care of in between. They must balance employment and personal duties, but also as students, they must find time for lectures, study for assignments as well as engage in other academic related activities. 

Using survey questionnaire is another great and quite different approach comparing to the observation method. It aims to collect qualitative and quantitative data and gain insights into the topic of interest. I have decided to use the survey as my second method because by asking the correct questions, it is very efficient way in finding the user needs, experiences, and issues.

## Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

I am happy of the work I have done for moodlify, but it is definitely still a work in progress. There are many imrpovements that could be made in the fuctionalities and also in the styling. The limited time to build this project definetely played a key role but I still belive I did a good job with managing to connect and authenticate the users through Firebase.
